# SS25 model rocket
3D printed rocket components for the amazing Aaron Miles

## Sabots
To stabilize the rocket in the launch tube, upper and lower sabots were used. The full sabots were multi-day prints, so the upper and lower sabots were printed in two pieces which were joined on a cardboard backing.

## Grid fins
The SS25 has two types of grid fins for stabilization. Four of each type are needed for the launch. [PDF description](SS25_grid_fins.pdf)
