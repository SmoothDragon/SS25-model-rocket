# SS25 model rocket
3D printed rocket components for the amazing Aaron Miles

## Sabots
To stabilize the rocket in the launch tube, upper and lower sabots were used. The full sabots were multi-day prints, so the upper and lower sabots were printed in two pieces which were joined on a cardboard backing.

## Grid fins
The SS25 has two types of grid fins for stabilization.

Four of each type are needed for the launch. They specification for the STL files is given in the following PDF.
